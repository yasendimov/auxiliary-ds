# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**auxiliary-ds (AUX)** is the official design system for Auterion — an aerospace company building autonomous drone swarm systems. AUX is an installable Vue 3 component library published as an npm package. It serves four distinct UI contexts: foundation primitives, marketing/brand, conventional application UI, and aerospace mission-critical operational interfaces.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — Start dev server
- `pnpm build` — Production build
- `pnpm preview` — Preview production build locally
- `pnpm generate-tokens` — Regenerate `src/tokens/colors.css` from Radix + Auterion sources
- Dev server runs on **port 4747** (configured in vite.config.js)

## Stack

- **Vue 3** — Composition API only, `<script setup>` syntax, no Options API, no TypeScript, no JSX
- **Vite 7** — bundler and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — CSS-first config via `@tailwindcss/vite`, no `tailwind.config.js`
- **Vue Router** — docs app navigation, `src/router/index.js`
- **pnpm** — package manager, always use pnpm not npm or yarn
- **Fonts** — Inter Variable (UI), JetBrains Mono (data/code) via Google Fonts
- **@radix-ui/colors** — Radix color scales, consumed by `scripts/generate-tokens.js`

## Token Architecture

Colors follow a strict two-layer system:

**Layer 1 — Primitives** (in `src/tokens/colors.css`)
Raw 12-step scales defined as CSS custom properties on `:root` (light) and `[data-theme="dark"]` (dark). These are never used directly in components.
```css
:root               { --blue-9: #1475ff; }
[data-theme="dark"] { --blue-9: #1475ff; }
```

**Layer 2 — Semantic Aliases** (in Tailwind `@theme`)
Intent-based names that reference primitives via `var()`. Defined once, resolve automatically when theme changes.
```css
@theme {
  --color-action: var(--blue-9);
}
```

**Rules:**
- Components ALWAYS use semantic tokens (`--color-action`), NEVER raw scale values (`--blue-9`) or hardcoded hex values
- Tailwind utilities are generated from `@theme` — use `bg-action`, `text-content-high`, `border-line` etc.
- Never use inline styles for colors
- Never use Tailwind's default color palette (blue-500, gray-900 etc.) — always use AUX semantic tokens

### Spacing

Three page-level constants in `src/tokens/spacing.css`, registered in `@theme` so Tailwind generates utilities:
- `--spacing-page-x` (24px) → `px-page-x` — horizontal page padding
- `--spacing-page-y` (24px) → `py-page-y` — vertical page padding
- `--spacing-section` (48px) → `gap-section`, `mb-section` — between major sections

Everything else uses Tailwind's built-in spacing scale directly. Layout density varies by context:
- **Marketing**: `px-6 md:px-8 lg:px-12`, `py-16 md:py-24`
- **Application**: `px-6 py-6`
- **Operational**: `px-2 py-2`, instruments `p-1.5`

## Color System

- **Base scale** — Pure achromatic neutral (custom Auterion, no hue tint)
- **Blue scale** — Primary accent, #1475ff at step 9 (stable across themes)
- **Radix chromatic scales** — Full set for status and data visualization
- **Step 9 rule** — The accent fill (step 9) is always the same hex in both light and dark mode
- **Scale inversion** — In dark mode, step 1 is darkest, step 12 is lightest (opposite of light mode)

## Alert Hierarchy (OpenBridge Standard)

Operational components MUST follow the OpenBridge aviation alert hierarchy strictly:

- **Alarm** — red, immediate action required
- **Warning** — orange, urgent attention needed
- **Caution** — amber, awareness required
- **OK** — green, normal state

Every alert level currently has 3 token variants: `base`, `subtle`, `content`. Planned expansion to 7: adding `hover`, `muted`, `border`, `fill`.
Status colors are NEVER used decoratively — only for their designated alert level.

## Theming

- Dark mode is primary — always design and test dark first
- Theme controlled via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` element
- `data-theme="dark"` — default
- `data-theme="light"` — secondary
- Additional themes planned: OpenBridge, high-contrast
- Theme switching swaps Layer 1 primitives only — semantic aliases resolve automatically

## Typography

- **Inter Variable** — all UI text
- **JetBrains Mono** — telemetry values, coordinates, data readouts, code, token names
- 13-step type scale from 12px to 128px
- Three weights only: Regular (400), Medium (500), SemiBold (600)
- OpenType features enabled by default: tabular figures, contextual alternates
- Tracking tightens as size increases: -2% body, -3% heading, -4% display
- Never use italic in operational interfaces
- Uppercase only for labels and overlines — never body text

## Design Philosophy

See docs/design-philosophy.md for the full rationale.

The AUX visual style is **functional authority** — it needs to look like it controls things that fly. Every visual decision must serve one of these principles:

**When writing any component, ask:**
- Is this language or data? Language gets Inter. Data gets JetBrains Mono.
- Is this a heading or body? Headings get SemiBold with tight negative tracking. Body gets Regular.
- Is this decorative or functional? If decorative, remove it.
- Is this an operational interface? If yes, fixed sizes only — never fluid or responsive type.
- Does this color carry signal? alarm/warning/caution/ok colors must mean that alert level — never use them decoratively.
- Does this need a shadow or gradient? Almost certainly not. Remove it.
- Does this need rounded corners? Only on interactive elements — never on data displays.

**The rules:**
- Dark mode is the native state — always design and test dark first
- Density over whitespace — pack information, make it scannable
- Three weights only — Regular, Medium, SemiBold. Never a fourth.
- One typeface — Inter Variable for everything except data
- No gradients, no decorative shadows, no rounded corners on data
- Blue is interactive only — never use it as a status or alert color
- Monospace is data only — never use it decoratively

## Design Decision Framework

When a design choice is unclear, apply these questions in order:

1. Which context is this? Operational, application, or marketing? The answer governs density, motion, radius, and shadow.
2. Does this element encode meaning? If yes, it stays. If purely decorative, remove it.
3. Does this work across both themes? Test light and dark. If it fails in either, it is not finished.
4. Does this follow the grid? Every measurement resolves to 4px multiples. If it does not, justify why.
5. Is the color semantic? Alert colors for alerts only. Blue for interactive only. Everything else from neutral or chromatic palette.
6. Would this survive in a cockpit? For operational components: if an operator under stress could misread this, it is wrong.
7. Is this the simplest version? Remove one more thing. If it still works, the removed thing was not needed.

## Iconography Rules

- Optical sizes: 16px for UI, 20px for navigation, 24px for feature callouts
- Stroke weight: 1.5px consistent across the set
- Style: outlined, geometric, minimal detail — legible at small sizes in dense layouts
- Always inherit currentColor — never hardcoded fills or strokes
- Never used decoratively — every icon encodes a specific action or object
- Operational icons (alert indicators, vehicle status) must be unambiguous at 16px on both themes

## Data Visualization Rules

- Alert colors are reserved for their alert meanings — a red line on a chart means alarm-level data, nothing else
- Series differentiation uses the chromatic palette (non-blue, non-alert hues)
- Axes and labels: text-content-dim
- Data values: monospace
- Grid lines: --color-line at reduced opacity — never competing with data
- Every chart must be legible in both light and dark themes

## Component Rules

- Every component uses `<script setup>` and Composition API
- Props defined with `defineProps()`, events with `defineEmits()`
- No inline styles — Tailwind classes only
- No hardcoded colors, spacing, or font values — always use tokens
- Components in `foundation/` are the only ones allowed to use raw Tailwind utilities
- Components in `marketing/`, `application/`, `operational/` must compose from `foundation/` primitives
- Every component must work in both light and dark mode
- Operational components must strictly follow OpenBridge conventions

## Component Categories

- **Foundation** — Primitives shared across all categories. Button, Input, Badge, Typography, Icon, etc.
- **Marketing** — Public-facing brand components. Hero, FeatureCard, Nav, Footer, CTA, etc.
- **Application** — Conventional SaaS UI. Tables, Forms, Modals, Dashboards, Navigation, etc.
- **Operational** — Aerospace mission-critical UI. Telemetry cards, Status bars, Alert panels, Mission timeline, Fleet lists, Map overlays. Must follow OpenBridge alert hierarchy.

## Branch Naming

Format: `prefix/weird-name`

Prefixes:
- `feature/` — new components or features
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `chore/` — maintenance, config, tooling
- `docs/` — documentation updates
- `release/` — release branches

Example: `feature/grumpy-tooltip`, `fix/lost-token`

## Publishing

- Published as npm package `auxiliary-ds`
- `src/` is the published package (build/export config not yet set up)
- `src/docs/` is the documentation app — not published
- License: Apache 2.0
- Structured for future monorepo split into `@aux/tokens`, `@aux/icons`, `@aux/components`

## Visual Language

- Swiss precision — structured layouts, consistent spacing, intentional hierarchy
- Every visual decision must be justified by function, not decoration
- Density over whitespace in operational interfaces, breathing room in marketing
- No gradients, no shadows for decoration — only for functional depth (elevation, overlay)
- Icons are monochromatic, inherit `currentColor`, never hardcoded fills
- Borders and dividers use `--color-line` — never arbitrary opacity hacks
